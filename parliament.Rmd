## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Reading Data
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
parliament = read.csv("parliament.csv")
```

## 1) Identifying year wise total number of electors and voters. Also computing percentage of voters.
```{r}
par_year = parliament %>% group_by(YEAR) %>% summarise(AnnualVoters = sum(VOTES, na.rm=T), AnnualElectors = sum(unique(ELECTORS), na.rm=T), VotersPercentage=AnnualVoters*100/AnnualElectors)
par_year
```
## 2) Identifying year wise percentage of male and female candidates
```{r}
SexFiltered = filter(parliament, SEX=='M' | SEX=='F')
SexPerc = SexFiltered %>% group_by(YEAR) %>% summarise(MaleTot = sum(if_else(SEX=='M',1,0)), MalePerc= MaleTot*100/n(), FemalePerc = 100*(1-MalePerc*.01))
SexPerc
```

## 3) Computing party-wise total number of candidates won so far & Displaying top ten parties alone
```{r}
CandWon = parliament %>% group_by(PARTY) %>% summarise(TotalWon = sum(if_else(Position==1,1,0))) %>% arrange(-TotalWon)
head(CandWon,10)
```

## 4) Identifying year-wise, which party has won (based upon total number constituencies won)
```{r}
Const = parliament %>% group_by(YEAR,PARTY) %>% summarise(totConst = sum(if_else(Position==1,1,0)))
ConstWon = Const %>% group_by(YEAR) %>% summarise(MaxConst= max(totConst), Party = PARTY[which.max(totConst)])
ConstWon
```

## 5) Identifying year wise percentage of winning for female candidates
```{r}
FilterSex = filter(parliament, SEX=='M'| SEX=='F', Position==1)
FemWin = FilterSex %>% group_by(YEAR) %>% summarise(totFem = sum(if_else(SEX=='F',1,0)), FemPerc = totFem*100/n())
FemWin
```
